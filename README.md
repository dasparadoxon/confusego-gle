confusego*gle
=============

A little python program to confuse go*gles data mining operations. 

It is under no license except the licenses that I need to apply from the software I am using (python etc.).
So it is free of use, open source, do with it whatever you want, with absolutly no warranties etc, etc.

Using
=====

- Python 2.7.x
- Tkinter (Tcl/Tk)

TODO
====

Writing Classes out of it and doing packages 

Plans
*****

- Nicer GUI
- Options
- More Options
- Even more Options
- Different Search Engines
- Different Data Collection and Abusing Entities
- Own Dictionary 
- Much more sophisticated and personalised algorithm
- Mobile Versions

Noticed
=======

- If you use just one dictionary, Google most of the time recognize that, depending on the words.
  So thats not very helpfull.
